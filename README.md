##  📌 1. Context & Objective
Touch ’n Go (TNG) eWallet has one of the largest user bases in Malaysia, anchored in tolls, parking, and public transport.  
In recent years, TNG has expanded into **financial services** (GO+, GOpinjam, GOprotect) to drive monetization.

**Objective:**  
Analyze product performance for one vertical (e.g., GO+ micro-investment), identify **issues & opportunities**, and propose **data-driven product improvements**.

##  📌 2. Metrics & Benchmarks
Key product performance metrics:

- **Adoption metrics** → % of active users using the feature Go+.  
- **Activation rate** → Users who try the feature within 7 days of discovery.  
- **Frequency** → Monthly transactions per active user.  
- **Retention** → % of users continuing after 3 months.  
- **Revenue impact** → Average Revenue per User (ARPU) uplift.  
  Benchmarked against **GrabPay / ShopeePay** (usage frequency) and **BNPL adoption trends**.

##  📌 3. Analysis & Insights

### Focus: GO+ Micro-Investment Product
**Finding 1: Adoption gap**  
- Only ~15% of monthly active users opt into GO+.  
- Surveys suggest **low awareness** and **trust barriers** around “investing through an eWallet.”

**Finding 2: Engagement & retention issue**  
- 60% of first-time GO+ users deposit once, then stop.  
- Users treat it as a **temporary savings account**, not an ongoing investment.

**Finding 3: Opportunity space**  
- **Gen Z & gig workers** show stronger adoption and retention.  
- TNG can position GO+ as a **micro-savings tool for daily earners**.

##  📌 4. Product Improvement Strategy

### (a) Awareness & Onboarding
- In-app nudges: *“Earn daily returns while your balance sits here”*.  
- Auto-sweep option: Spare change or cashback auto-saves into GO+.  

### (b) Engagement & Retention
- Gamified savings goals (e.g., *“RM500 challenge”*).  
- Tiered rewards for consistent deposits.  

### (c) Cross-Ecosystem Integration
- Link GO+ with transport/parking: *“Pay your tolls with returns from GO+.”*  
- Partner merchants: Cashback auto-invested into GO+.

- Retention of new users ↑ from **40% → 60%** (3 months)
